# _"I want to contribute to ThunderTable!"_

👋🏻 Hi there, we're super excited that you want to contribute to ThunderTable! ⛈

ThunderTable is a project used within [3 SIDED CUBE](3sidedcube.com), built over many years, to power our award-winning iOS apps. It is to be used alongside [ThunderCloud](https://github.com/3sidedcube/ThunderCloud), [ThunderRequest](https://github.com/3sidedcube/ThunderRequest), [ThunderCollection](https://github.com/3sidedcube/ThunderCollection), and [ThunderBasics](https://github.com/3sidedcube/ThunderBasics) to provide a foundation for apps to be built against.

## _"How can I contribute?"_

Before you get started, please take a look at [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and make sure to adhere to it ☮️.

Then:
- Clone the project down via your preferred means.
- Run the project! ✨

### _"How can I report bugs?"_

- Ensure the bug hasn't already been reported in GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/3sidedcube/ThunderTable/issues)
- If you can't find a bug which seems to match yours, or you're unsure please create a [new one](https://github.com/3sidedcube/ThunderTable/issues)

### _"How can I fix bugs?"_

- If you find a bug, please create a PR _and also_ [create an issue](https://github.com/3sidedcube/ThunderTable/issues) so it can be tagged against a specific release.

### _"What about fixing whitespacing/formatting or making a cosmetic patch?"_

- Please go ahead and fix whitespacing (we indent using spaces, please also do this... even if you don't agree!)

### _"What about adding functionality / features?"_

Please go ahead and add new functionality and features, however it may be wise to [create an issue](https://github.com/3sidedcube/ThunderTable/issues) (or check the open [issues](https://github.com/3sidedcube/ThunderTable/issues)) first to make sure it isn't already being worked on, and it remains in scope of the ThunderCloud framework.
